chenryn's changelog
================

## percentile panel

Percentile is a great data analysis method. Elasticsearch add percentile aggregation support after version 1.1.0. But Kibana v3 use an outdate elastic.js which don't support aggergation! So I write this panel using native angularjs `$.http` api.

*Elasticsearch had add percentile rank in version 1.3.0, so exciting!*

*Tips: merged new version of elasticjs at 2014/08/15, should rewrite this panel now.*(DONE at 2014/08/16)

## range panel

I need a pie chart to show percentile of range sections(percentile rank wait for only one value). So I use RangeFacet to implement this.

Here is the rendering:

And you can add more range sections as you like:

## china map

Use map.cn.js from <http://jvectormap.com/maps/countries/china/>, delete `CN-` because `filter/geoip` don't have such prefix.

Add Taiwan to this map.

## term_stats map

Provide a way to choose the stat to display into the map, not only the total number of hits but also min/max/total etc.
